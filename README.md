Hello,
I'm learning how i2c protcol works so i created a project with proteus simulation and also code has been written in atmel studio

library exicts in the folder.

I connected 2 slave with one master so we can see how it works .

next step i want to do is to write directly into register and also i want to learn how multi master works so i need to figure it out.
